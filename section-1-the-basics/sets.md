## Sets

Removing duplicates from lists with a`for`loop works, but there is an alternative technique. Python includes several data structures other than lists for storing collections, and one of them is perfectly suited for storing unique elements: sets.

Sets are collections of unique elements without any particular ordering.

You can add elements to sets, but you don't use `append`method like lists, instead sets have the`add`method:

```
country_set.add("Florin")
```
